# RNN-TimeSeries
Predicting the behaviour of functions 


## Building the Neural network
When we deal with Time Series we need to prevent some problems such as vanishing gradient. Therefore we use particular architecture. The LSTM is the most common but recently a new one has became the state of the art architecture ensuring good result and better performances.

## The predicition 
Here we predicted the behaviour of the function sinus on a regular discretization. I also add the alternative of another prediction on an irregular time basis. 
Here are both result:
